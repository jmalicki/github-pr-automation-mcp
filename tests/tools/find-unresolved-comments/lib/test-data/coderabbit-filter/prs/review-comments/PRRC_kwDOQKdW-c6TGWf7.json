One may be redundant; ensure they‚Äôre not double-defining macros and versions stay in lockstep.\n\n\nIf rmcp already re-exports the macros with its \"macros\" feature, you can drop the extra crate:\n\n```diff\n rmcp = { version = \"0.8\", features = [\"client\", \"server\", \"macros\"] }\n-rmcp-macros = \"0.8\"\n```\n\nTo verify using public docs, please run:\n\n---\n\nüåê Web query:\n\n```web\nDoes the rmcp crate (version 0.8) re-export its procedural macros when the \"macros\" feature is enabled, or is the separate rmcp-macros crate required?\n```\n\nüí° Result:\n\nShort answer: You don't need to depend on rmcp-macros directly ‚Äî enabling rmcp's \"macros\" feature pulls in and exposes the procedural macros so you can use e.g. rmcp::tool / #[tool]. [1][2]\n\nSources:\n- rmcp crate docs showing the #[tool] attribute and examples using rmcp::{tool, tool_router}. [1]\n- rmcp Cargo feature listing: the \"macros\" feature enables the rmcp-macros dependency. [2]\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Remove redundant rmcp-macros direct dependency**\n\nVerified: rmcp's \"macros\" feature re-exports the procedural macros and pulls in rmcp-macros as a transitive dependency. You don't need rmcp-macros as a direct dependency.\n\n```diff\n rmcp = { version = \"0.8\", features = [\"client\", \"server\", \"macros\"] }\n-rmcp-macros = \"0.8\"\n serde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n```\n\n<!-- suggestion_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>üìù Committable suggestion</summary>\n\n> ‚ÄºÔ∏è **IMPORTANT**\n> Carefully review the code before committing.
