This include-then-exclude pattern can be confusing.\n\n\n\nConsider either:\n1. Explicitly listing scripts to include rather than using a blanket include with exceptions\n2. Moving the version check script to a different location if it shouldn't be linted\n\n```diff\n-    ignores: ['dist/', 'node_modules/', 'coverage/', '*.js', '!scripts/*.js', 'scripts/pre-push-version-check.js', 'commitlint.config.cjs']\n+    ignores: ['dist/', 'node_modules/', 'coverage/', '*.js', '!scripts/generate-version-info.js', '!scripts/release.js', '!scripts/install-cli.cjs', 'commitlint.config.cjs']\n```\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.husky/pre-commit (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`10-10`: **Consider consistent handling of empty file lists.**\n\nWhile the `|| true` pattern prevents failures when no files match, calling ESLint with an empty file list might produce warnings or unexpected behavior.\n\n\n\nConsider making both linting commands consistent by using a portable xargs pattern or explicit file checks:\n\n```diff\n-npx eslint --fix $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$' || true)\n+git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$' | xargs npx eslint --fix || true\n```\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>scripts/pre-push-version-check.js (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`68-71`: **Error handling is too permissive.**\n\nCatching all errors and allowing the push to continue (returning `true`) means that git command failures or other unexpected errors will silently skip validation.\n\n\n\nConsider being more selective about which errors to ignore:\n\n```diff\n  } catch (error) {\n-   console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not check version tags, skipping validation');\n-   return true;\n+   // Only skip validation for specific expected errors\n+   if (error.message.includes('not a git repository') || error.code === 'ENOENT') {\n+     console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not check version tags, skipping validation');\n+     return true;\n+   }\n+   throw error;\n  }\n```\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>üìú Review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used**: Path: .coderabbit.yaml\n\n**Review profile**: CHILL\n\n**Plan**: Pro\n\n<details>\n<summary>üì• Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between 38d8139587d670315ea843dd9f77703a0a1afd84 and 48b649b8ff1a5cb34717ecaa157daa358d485f3d.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>‚õî Files ignored due to path filters (28)</summary>\n\n* `README.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`\n* `docs/AI_DECISION_GUIDE.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/API_DESIGN.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/BUGFIX_CLI_DEFAULTS.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/CLI_INSTALLATION.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/CODERABBIT_NITS_PARSING_DESIGN.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/DATA_MODELS.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/DESIGN_SUMMARY.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/GIT_HOOKS.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/INDEX.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/PREFERENCE_HINTS.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/REVIEW_BODY_EXAMPLE.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/REVIEW_BODY_PARSING.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_OPTIMIZATION.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `docs/VERSION_VALIDATION.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`, `!docs/**`\n* `package-lock.json` is excluded by `!**/package-lock.json`\n* `tests/e2e.disabled/README.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`\n* `tests/integration/README.md` is excluded by `!**/*.md`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>üìí Files selected for processing (8)</summary>\n\n* `.husky/commit-msg` (1 hunks)\n* `.husky/pre-commit` (1 hunks)\n* `.husky/pre-push` (1 hunks)\n* `.markdownlint.json` (1 hunks)\n* `commitlint.config.cjs` (1 hunks)\n* `eslint.config.js` (1 hunks)\n* `package.json` (2 hunks)\n* `scripts/pre-push-version-check.js` (1 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>üîá Additional comments (7)</summary><blockquote>\n\n<details>\n<summary>.husky/commit-msg (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`1-5`: **LGTM!**\n\nThe commit message hook correctly delegates to commitlint for validation.
